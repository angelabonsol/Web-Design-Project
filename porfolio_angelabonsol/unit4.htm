     <p>
       In this section, we had learned multiple graphic features
       that can be done with our website including:
       <ul>
         <li>Web Photo Album
           <p>There are different types of picture formats, where
             one format must be used for a specific purpose.
             <ul>
               <li>JPG- used for still images and photography
               <li>GIF- used for simple animations and graphics
                 with flat colors and without gradients.
               <li>PNG-8 - used for better transparency but
                 no animation and great for icons.
               <li>PNG-24 -Handles still images and transparency.
               <li>SVG- used for graphics, logos for web, retina
                 and high-dpi screens.
             </ul>
             It is better to always add an "alt=" feature to caption your images,
             even for the simplest things.
           </p>
         <li>Button
           <p>
             For a more complex button, it is best to layer them.
             When making buttons, it is better to give more space when editing them.
            "<link rel="shortcut icon" href=".ico">"  is the format used to make an icon.
           </p>
         <li>Web Page Banner
           <p>
             Layering pictures is the key to making a banner. Specific selection tools are used.
             Blending pictures together to make it more smooth. Choosing a specific
             banner color background is also a must so that it blends in with the website.

       </ul>
