     <h1>Unit 3</h1>
     <p>
       In this unit, I had learned about the process of styling our websites.
       This included a focus on the following topics:
       <ul>
         <li>Color in CSS
            <p> Color Scheme is important to the the target audience of our
              websites. We have to choose a color scheme that should match
              what our website contains. Using a hex triplet to identify the
              color we want is handy so that we get the exact color we are
              trying to get for our website.
            </p>
         <li>Typography in CSS
           <p> Styling our text was also important to make it more appealing
             to our audience and so that some words stood out more than others.
           </p>
         <li>The Box Model in CSS
           <p> Knowing the various layers of the box model is important to
             identify which layer of our website is having problems. Boxing
             or bordering your text also helps to make other text stand out
             than others.
           </p>
         <li>The Role of ID and Class in CSS
           <p>It was important to mark our websites for the type of class
             they are, so we can style them differently. It was also
             important to ID them, so that we can link them to directly
             go from one webpage to another.
           </p>
       </ul>
       My favorite part about this unit was choosing the colors for our website.
       I think it is important to choose the right colors that blend in well.
