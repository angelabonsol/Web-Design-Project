     <h1>Unit 5</h1>
     <p>
       In this Unit we focused on learning a programming language known as javascript,
       which is a Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language, meaning they are coded
       using objects, which is a data structure that combines properties and methods
       together.
       <ul>
         <li>Functions: or a method, holds what a specific command will do, which can be
              assigned to any text or button.
         <li> Debugging: the process of fixing code for improvement or to make it work. It
            could be because of inefficiency or synthax error.
         <li> If/Else: a type of loop in the programming language that if the statement in
           the parenthesis is true, the "instructions" below it is executed; if not (else),
           then it follows the "instructions" under 'else'.
       </ul>
