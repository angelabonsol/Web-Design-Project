          <h2><a name= "usability">Usability Study Report</h2>

         <h3>Website:<a href= https://www.nintendo.com>https://www.nintendo.com</a></h3>
         <p>
           The target audience: Gamers of any age <br>
           <br>
           Three representative tasks:
           <ul>
             <li>Check how much a Nintendo Switch is
             <li>Find out what their best sellers are
             <li>Look for tech support for your broken console
           </ul>
         </p>

          <h3>Method</h3>
          <h4>
            What website did you study? Who is the target audience?
            What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?
          </h4>
             <p>
               I studied a gaming company called Nintendo, where the target
               audiences are gamers of all ages, since they make games that
               are kid friendly but also appeal to adults(family games).
               The three tasks I made my subjects do is check how much
               the current most popular Nintendo console, which is the
               Nintendo Switch. The second task I made my subject do is
               look for the tech support for, lets say, their broken console.
               The last task I made them do is find out what the other best
               sellers are of the company.
             </p>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <h4>
            Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them?
            Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps,
            did it take to complete the tasks?
          </h4>
             <p>
               The subjects were able to complete the tasks that I have assigned them
               For one of them who was familiar with the website, he had easily found
               where the best sellers are. However, it took a little more time for for
               two others. Overall, they had spent an average of 6 minutes. The first
               two tasks were done in 2 minutes, meanwhile the last task took them the
               most time. The average number of steps that took them to complete all 3
               tasks were 20.

          <h3>Discussion</h3>
          <h4>
             What did you learn from this study about the website?
             Is the current design effective? Why or why not?
             How might the site be designed differently so that users
             could more easily perform the representative tasks?
          </h4>
             <p>
               From this study about the website, I had learned that although a website
               might be easily accessible to us, it might not be to others. That if you're
               not used to exploring a website, it might be difficult to find things.
               The current design, I believe, is still effective because of how much more
               organized it actually is compared to others website I've seen. However,
               if you're not the type of person that likes to keep clicking and exploring
               the website, it might not be that efficient. I think if the best seller page
               was featured on the home page, which just makes sense, it would have been
               easily found by those who parents who are shopping for their children and
               have no idea what they want to get them.
